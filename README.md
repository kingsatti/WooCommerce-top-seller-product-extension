The WooCommerce Best Selling Products extension by Qaisar Satti enables you to display the top seller's section on your website. Using the shortcode, you can display the top-selling block on the homepage, shop, products, categories, or anywhere else on your website.

The Woocommerce Top-Selling Products extension makes it easy to showcase your store's most popular products and inform users about which items they should prioritize. 

For many users, the public perception of a product is a huge deal, and if they find out that a product they are considering is a best seller, it can push them to make a quicker purchase decision.
